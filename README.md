# Terminal-weather

This project is a simple command-line interface (CLI) application that retrieves the current weather for a given city using the [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/). The application converts a city name into geographic coordinates using the Open-Meteo geocoding API and then fetches the current weather for that location.

## Features

- **Geocoding:** Converts a city name to latitude and longitude.
- **Current Weather:** Retrieves data including temperature, wind speed, and weather code.
- **Interactive CLI:** Prompts the user to enter a city and displays real-time weather information.

## Installation
Open terminal and run:
  ```bash
  pip install requests
  git clone https://github.com/NikosDev-cmd/Terminal-weather.git
  cd Terminal-weather
  ```
## Usage
